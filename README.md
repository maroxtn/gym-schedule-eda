# Gym Attendance EDA

This is a simple project I have done. It's an exploratory data analysis of a gym attendance dataset, and it's schedule. In this body of work, I analysed the frequency of clients based on hours / type of work, and gave my suggestions for a better schedule.

I also visualized data using matplotlib library and seaborn. The dataset is a small dataset (2730, 1806 recorded class + 924 live class attendance). 

The Excel file contains three sheets: The current class schedule, the live attendance of every class, the classes attended from the recorded collections. Take a look at the analysis in the `EDA notebook`.
